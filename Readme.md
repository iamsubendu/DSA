# Data structure

Way to organize data so that we can use it effeciently

### Types of Data structure

1. Primitive Data Structure : Integer, Float, Character, Pointer
2. Non-primitive Data Structure: Linear, Non-Linear

Linear :

1. Static -> Arrays <br>
2. Dynamic -> Vector, Linked list, Stack, Queue

Operation can be performed from start or at end

Non-Linear Lists : Tree, Graph, Table/Set <br>
Operation can be performed from anywhere

# Algorithm

Steps to structure the data as required or set of wee-defined instructions to solve a problem

### Characteristics

1. Well defined inputs and outputs
2. Each step should be clear and unambigous
3. Language independent

## Operations

1. Traverse: Read data/s
2. Insert
3. Deletion
4. Searching
5. Sorting
6. Merging

## Algorithm analysis

We evaluate the performance of an algorithm in terms of its input size

Time Complexity<br> Amount of time taken by an algorithm to run <br><br>
Space Complexity<br>
Amount of memory taken by an algorithm to run

## Time complexity

It can be done by asymptotic notations

1. Big-O Notation (O) - Worst case complexity
2. Omega Notation (&Omega;) - Best case complexity
3. Theta Notation (&theta;) - Average case complexity

O(1), O(logn) are very good <br>

O(2^n), O(n!) are really bad time complexities if possible

// Array.push() and Array.unshift().

// pop() removes an element from the end of an array, while shift() removes
// an element from the beginning.The key difference between pop() and shift()
// and their cousins push() and unshift(), is that neither method takes
// parameters, and each only allows an array to be modified by a single
// element at a time.

// if we want to remove an element from somewhere in the middle ? Or
// remove more than one element at once ? Well, that's where splice()
// comes in.splice() allows us to do just that: remove any number of
// consecutive elements from anywhere in an array.

// splice() can take up to 3 parameters, but for now, we'll focus on just
// the first 2. The first two parameters of splice() are integers which
// represent indexes, or positions, of items in the array that splice()
// is being called upon.And remember, arrays are zero - indexed, so to
// indicate the first element of an array, we would use 0. splice()'s first
// parameter represents the index on the array from which to begin removing
// elements, while the second parameter indicates the number of elements
// to delete.

  } else {

// The third parameter, comprised of one or more element(s), to add
// to the array.This can be incredibly useful for quickly switching
// out an element, or a set of elements, for another.

// The next method we will cover is slice().Rather than modifying an array,
// slice() copies or extracts a given number of elements to a new array,
// leaving the array it is called upon untouched.slice() takes only 2
// parameters â€” the first is the index at which to begin extraction, and
// the second is the index at which to stop extraction(extraction will
// occur up to, but not including the element at this index).

// Since arrays can be changed, or mutated, at any time, there's no guarantee
// about where a particular piece of data will be on a given array, or if
// that element even still exists.Luckily, JavaScript provides us with another
// built -in method, indexOf(), that allows us to quickly and easily check for
// the presence of an element on an array.indexOf() takes an element as a
// parameter, and when called, it returns the position, or index, of that
// element, or - 1 if the element does not exist on the array.

// JavaScript offers several built in methods that each iterate over arrays in
